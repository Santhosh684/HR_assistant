HR Recruitment Copilot

An AI-powered tool that assists HR teams in shortlisting candidates based on how well their resumes match a given Job Description (JD).

Built using Python, Streamlit, and free open-source LLMs (via Hugging Face), this copilot extracts text from resumes, compares it against a JD, scores applicants, and shortlists or eliminates them based on a score threshold.
